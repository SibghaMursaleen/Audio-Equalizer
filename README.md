# Audio-Equalizer
This project is a MATLAB-based 3-band audio equalizer that allows real-time control of Bass, Mid, and Treble frequencies using interactive sliders. It uses 10th-order Butterworth IIR filters to provide sharp frequency separation and includes visual plots and audio playback for a complete signal processing experience.
